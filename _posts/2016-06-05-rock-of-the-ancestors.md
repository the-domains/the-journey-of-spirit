  Burkina Faso means ‘Land of Honourable/Incorruptible Men’. ‘Burkina’ is a
  Moore word meaning ‘honour’. ‘Faso’ is the Dioula word for ‘fatherland’. The
  Fulfulde language is reflected in the term ‘Burkinabe’, because ‘be’ is its
  plural for people. This use of all three main languages symbolises the unity
  of the country.
