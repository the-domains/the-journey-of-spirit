# Burkina Faso

Burkina Faso means 'Land of Honourable/Incorruptible Men'. 'Burkina' is a _Moore _word meaning 'honour'. 'Faso' is the _Dioula _word for 'fatherland'. The _Fulfulde _language is reflected in the term 'Burkinabe', because 'be' is its plural for people. This use of all three main languages symbolises the unity of the country.

# Ethnic Relations. 

### Mossi

The Mossi make up the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso. They are the second-largest ethnic group in CÃ´te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). The Mossi were one of the last peoples in Africa to be colonized. 

The political system of the Mossi was very closely connected to their religion. For this reason, the Mossi rulers resisted conversion to Islam, even though other African groups accepted the new religion (after about the tenth century). Even so, Mossi culture shows Muslim influences. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ca821406-7fb6-4f6d-93e3-dce282434585.jpg)

### Dagara

The Dagara tribe of West Central Africa successfully categorize their people into five different categories: fire, water, mineral, earth and nature. These are shown above on the African Wheel with the colors the Dagara normally associate with each type. Each of the five types of people play a very specific role. Every person born into this world comes from one of these categories in order to help fulfill the kind of function that that category of people is supposed to fulfill in order to keep the community together
