  Ghana contains great diversity of ethnic groups. The Akan are the most
  numerous, consisting of over 40 percent of the population. They are followed
  by the Ewe, Ga, Adangme, Guan, and Kyerepong in the south. The largest
  northern groups are the Gonja, Dagomba, and Mamprussi, but the region contains
  many small decentralized communities, such as the Talensi, Konkomba, and
  Lowiili. In addition, significant numbers of Mossi from Burkina Faso have
  immigrated as agricultural and municipal workers. Nigerian Hausa are widely
  present as traders.

The Ga-Adangbe people inhabit the Accra Plains. The Adangbe are found to the east, the Ga groups, to the west of the Accra coastlands. Although both languages are derived from a common proto-Ga-Adangbe ancestral language, modern Ga and Adangbe are mutually unintelligible. The modern Adangbe include the people of Shai, La, Ningo, Kpone, Osudoku, Krobo, Gbugble, and Ada, who speak different dialects. The Ga also include the Ga-Mashie groups occupying neighborhoods in the central part of Accra, and other Gaspeakers who migrated from Akwamu, Anecho in Togo, Akwapim, and surrounding areas.
